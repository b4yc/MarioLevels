so how does this work

we need to define levels

prototype of levels, so to speak

we thought

levels in mario are traversed left to right

things are defined by what comes before them

isn't this like a finite state machine?

can't we define the process of building a level with an automaton

and therefore, the set of levels themselves,

with a grammar?

we called those grammars schematics

chapter 3 will take care of the technicalities of how to write and parse the schematics themselve

first, we'll take a look at them from an abstract point of view

so each schematic is set to represent one of the cluster we found

players belonging to a cluster are to have a common characteristic

take a look at them

so each schematic is to reflect those characteristic that these players find enjoyable

this is a bit of a leap of faith, as anything in game design

it's only after trial and error that the conclusions we develop from these data are confirmed

let's make a run of each cluster and see how is it like

CLUSTER 1

so this cluster is so and so

so these players enjoy so and so

etc

Planes are cool, though.
