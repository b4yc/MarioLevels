so, profiling

what's the purpose?

well, identifying the user

getting to know him

getting some labels, some info

so we can tailor the rest of the process on him

some key values

we decided to do this

by clustering data from dozens of players

then assigning the incoming player

probabilities of membership to those clusters

we will call those probabilities

"loyalties"

they are the probabilities of belonging to one of those clusters

for all this clustering and assignation

we relied on the weka library

weka offers us

classes to represent cluster algorithms

our data records (called instances) 

and operate with them properly

as well as a GUI interface to run experiments and compare results

DATA GATHERING

so as we said

we want to use clustering

we need data for that

we looked back at the mario platform

and how the system would be evaluated

first a test level will be played

and the standard data recorded by the platform from that test level will be fed

for more info on that data recorded, consult section X later on

so we decided to use that same kind of data

for clustering, the data must be comparable

so we offered all players the same environment

one of the standard random levels generated by mario ai

they are simple, regular levels

very alike one to another

to deliver the game to the players

a zip package was prepared

it included an unmodified mario ai platform

as well with scripts for osx, windows and linux

that took care of launching the game and retrieving the metrics files into the root folder

this was done as to make extremely easy for novice players to play the game

the process was reduced

to double click

play

get the new files that showed up

and mail them

the package was distributed through social networks and word of mouth

twitter

facebook

reddit

people were encouraged to play with no restrictions or goal

just to enjoy themselves and play normally

death was fine too

a player with low level would die a lot

asking to deliver records from a level that has been passed

would'ven't been representative of his playstyle

at the time of this thesis, 120 records have been collected

they were anonymized before data processing

DATA COLLECTED

the mario platform

by default keeps two kinds of records, each in its file

one keeps step by step actions by the player

pressing a button, killing an enemy, jumping

the other keeps global metrics of a single game

time spent running, coins collected

since we want to identify the user by its general behaviour

we will use the latter file

it represents better the overall characteristics of his gameplay

table X represents the metrics recorded by the platform

PREPROCESSING

before going on with the data processing

we made a couple adjustments

first, five of the files (y, z and w) could not be read

we suspect the files to have been corrupted

perhaps on the generation at the user or on the shipping to us

they were excluded from the clustering, leaving us with 115

furthermore, the levels generated by the mario platform

lack some features of the game

namely, they have no gaps, or enemies other than goombas

therefore, metrics dealing with those features

are always zero

we removed them from the analysis

the number of characteristics analyzed was thus reduced from 45 to 31

they are marked in table X by being in italics

all records were read from the user files, stripped of those extraneous fields, and dumped into an arff file to be read by weka, ready for analysis.

HOW WEKA WORKS

weka offers several clusterers

they are
