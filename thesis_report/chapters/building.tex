talk about how we traverse the trace

and for each chunk

we call a function

each chunk is two blocks long

for several reasons

traces equal length

coherence and symmetry

minimum length for gaps or pipes

so we cna make for example a run down of how we take care

of different pieces

say, we place flatland, then the sprite or whatever

except if its a gap

the mayswap technique for blocks and enemies

or the decision on color palette (castle, overground, etc)

we cna also comment on what pieces we decided to include

how we left background hills out

(or perhaps is that a schematic decision?)
