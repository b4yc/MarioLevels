now it's time to make a choice with the clustring data we have

we will use the array of automata at our disposal to creates different

paths, so to speak

for the level

ok not paths

traces

they are like the DNA for a level

how do we get the automata?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Schematic reading}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

alright so

it's time to read them

schematics

we get them from some files we wrote

representing the different prototypes of levels

with added randomness, inherent

look at chapter X for more details

so we read them, you know

with parse2 library

each nonterminal is a dummy

chains

blah im lazy today

tomorrow more
