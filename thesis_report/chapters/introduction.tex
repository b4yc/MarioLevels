so

videogames huh

they are cool

they can even be art

they have come from so long

brief history why not

you know pong and so

arcade machines

collapse in the 80s

resurgence in the 90s

now firmly established

the casual market exploded

phones and all that

its pretty amazing

of course many more people play now

i mean

it's everywhere

at the same time

personalization rocks the world

amazon recommendations

apps in phones

d&d allows you to choose your own character

but as steve jobs says

you can't really know you

but data speaks for itself

like lastfm

(we can probably find a quote for that)

books of chose your own adventure too!

too much personalization is bad

ted talk

tailor things to target improves revenue

oh, by the way

longer life increases

you know

more game by the buck

more replayability

customers may not only take that into account

but a game that is played longer after

builds a market

offer more chances of them mentioning to their friends

so, better

like a film that is more watchable

it's like two games for one, or something
