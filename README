Lakitu is the custom code made to generate levels. That branch has been put on hold indefinitely, and its future is unclear, so ignore it for the moment.

MarioAIChallenge is the platform available at:

http://www.marioai.org/LevelGeneration/level-generation-track-source

A module for generating random levels based on player data is being developed under the package jorgedizpico and integrated on that platform.
