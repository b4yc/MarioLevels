A module for generating random levels based on player data is being developed and integrated on the MarioAIChallenge platform, available at:

http://www.marioai.org/LevelGeneration/source-code

The design currently consists of a finite state automaton creating the different parts of the level in each state.

The transitions are defined by the user data recorded, after being clustered into one of the groups found after collecting gameplay metrics.

The records for clustering were obtained by virally spreading mario.zip and asking people to play a level and send back the logs.
