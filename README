A module for generating random levels based on player data is being developed
and integrated on the MarioAIChallenge platform, available at:

http://www.marioai.org/LevelGeneration/source-code

The design currently consists of a finite state automaton
creating the different parts of the level in each state.
The transitions are defined by the user data recorded.
