A prototype implementing adaptive procedural content generation for the MarioAIChallenge championship:

http://www.marioai.org/LevelGeneration/source-code

The overall flow involves clustering the user into the pre-found groups, then mixing the grammars associated to each cluster, according to the membership probabilities. Then we traverse the grammar and output a level.

The records for clustering were obtained by virally spreading distpackage.zip and asking people to play a level and send back the logs.
