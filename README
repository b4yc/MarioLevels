This branch has been severely deprecated and abandoned.

It originally was going to allow playing several stages on a row,
recording all data under a name prompted at the beginning,
as well as the answer to a post-level survey;
then use that data as input for a genetic algorithm.

It got scrapped to focus efforts on a simpler algorithm
that required less data and could be submitted to the Mario AI Challenge at CIG 2012.

We therefore encourage you to check the cig branch, where the real work is being done.

Thanks.
