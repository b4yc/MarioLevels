A project developed for five months as a Master Thesis, but finally forced to drop by my supervisor, a decision I'm not particularly happy about. Now I work on it on my free time.

It implements a module for generating random levels based on player data. It's being integrated on the MarioAIChallenge platform, available at:

http://www.marioai.org/LevelGeneration/source-code

The overall flow involves clustering the user into the pre-found groups, then mixing the grammars associated to each cluster, according to the membership probabilities. Then we traverse the grammar and output a level.

The records for clustering were obtained by virally spreading mario.zip and asking people to play a level and send back the logs.
